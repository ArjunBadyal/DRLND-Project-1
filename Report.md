### Introduction
In this project the DQN algorithm was used to solve the environment. 

### Algorithm and Network Architecture
![DQN][image2]

### Results
The results below show that the environment was solved in 224 episodes i.e. this was the point where the average score over the last 100 episodes was greater than or equal to 13. The weights used at this point have been saved in the checkpoint.pth file and may be loaded to see the performance of the trained model. 


Episode 100	Average Score: 3.62

Episode 200	Average Score: 7.81

Episode 300	Average Score: 11.99

Episode 324	Average Score: 13.06

Environment solved in 224 episodes!	Average Score: 13.06
